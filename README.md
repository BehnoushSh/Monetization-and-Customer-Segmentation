# Monetization-and-Customer-Segmentation
Knowing the customer is the critical step in monetization and churn prediction planning.

One of the common-used approaches is RFM (Recency, Frequency and Monetory) to segment the clients according to their purchasing behavior. 
The output of this model categoriez the clients into three groups:
      • Low Value: Players who are less active, rarely purchase and generate low revenue
      >> Improve Retention
      • Mid Value: Players who behave moderately in all the three metrics
      >> Improve Retention + Increase Frequency
      • High value: Players we do not want to lose. Players who are active, frequently purchase and generate high revenue
      >> Increase Frequency
